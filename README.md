# Vehicle counting using StrongSORT with OSNet and YOLOv7


## Introduction

This repository contains a highly configurable two-stage-tracker that adjusts to different deployment scenarios. The detections generated by [YOLOv7](https://github.com/WongKinYiu/yolov7), a family of object detection architectures and models pretrained on the COCO dataset, are passed to [StrongSORT](https://github.com/dyhBUPT/StrongSORT)[](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.13514.pdf) which combines motion and appearance information based on [OSNet](https://github.com/KaiyangZhou/deep-person-reid)[](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.00953) in order to tracks the objects. It can track any object that your Yolov5 model was trained to detect. <br>

Note - This repository is uses the amazing codebase from https://github.com/bharath5673/StrongSORT-YOLO


## Before you run the tracker

1. Clone the repository recursively:

`git clone  https://github.com/deep-saket/YOLOv7_vehicle_counting `


2. Make sure that you fulfill all the requirements: Use the provided emvionment.yml file to create the conda env
`conda env create -f environment.yml`

## Tracking and Counting Vehicles

Tracking can be run on most video formats. Use the script tracv_v7.sh to for inference. <br>
Note - 
- Modify $VIDEO_PATH before running inference
- Modify $YOLOV7_WRIGHTS to point to the downloaded weights (from the above table)


```bash


$ source track_v7.sh
```
